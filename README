Goal is to Build a No Limit Bot that uses self play to train probably
I want to have a feature where you can choose how many opponents you play and
play a game of poker against a bunch of the bots as well as a feature where you
pass in the scenario and it outputs a betting decision.
Steps: Implement game logic

Train model
